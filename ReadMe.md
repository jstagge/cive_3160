This repository contains code associated with CIVE 3160 - Water Resources Engineering.

### Option 1: Run code live in the cloud with no prerequisites

Click at this badge to execute the analysis and replicate results using R-Studio in the cloud without needing to install R or its dependencies on your local machine.    
RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jstagge/cive_3160/master?urlpath=rstudio)

If you want to share this live RStudio link with others, please share this URL: http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jstagge/cive_3160/master?urlpath=rstudio

*Note*, URLs that contain (https://hub.mybinder.org.....) will become invalid after few minutes of inactivity.

Once RStudio launches online, it will come with all the prerequisites installed and ready to execute. So skip ```Rscript 00_prepare_file_system.R``` step in running the code.
